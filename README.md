# Desaturate

Python script to automatically desaturate an image. Currently only supports RGB images.

## Usage

Download desaturate.py and import the process method.
Syntax is as following:
    process(image_path)
The script will automatically save the desaturated image with the same name as the original except with a "_desaturated" appended to the end of the name.

## TODO

1. Add support for other image modes.
